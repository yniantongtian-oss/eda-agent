      underneath it, and the window gets wider every time another call site
      starts using this wrapper. Converting first and swapping the separator
      character afterwards has no window at all.

  the script on the StrToFloat line with an EConvertError dialog and takes
  the polling loop with it. Measured: a self-test passing 'abc' halted
  there, and the Except three lines below never ran.

  IsIntStr exists for exactly this reason on the integer side and says so.
  The float side was left on Try/Except alone, so any tool handed a
  non-numeric where it wanted a float had the same halt waiting for it:
  an arc angle, a standoff height, a model offset.

  Accepts a leading sign, digits, at most one '.', and an optional
  exponent. Deliberately does NOT accept ',' as a decimal separator:
  the caller forces '.' before parsing, so a comma is a bad value here

{ Inverse of ObjectTypeFromStringPCB. Written here, next to it, so the
  two cannot disagree about what a type is called.

  It exists because PCB.pas called ObjectIDToObjectName, which no Altium
  version declares. DelphiScript compiles a function only when it is
  first CALLED, so the fault stayed hidden from May until a DRC
  violation report finally reached that line, and it halted the polling
  loop: an undeclared identifier is not catchable, and the Try/Except
  wrapped around the call did nothing.

  The name looked safe because it appears in reference/, but the only
  file there using it is a vendored copy of this project's own PCB.pas.
  The independent scripts define their own ObjectIDToString by hand,
  which is the tell that no builtin exists. }
