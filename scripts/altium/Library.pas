      nothing said so. Nil makes the scope resolve to NOT_FOUND, which
      is a caller can act on. }
    {
      ONLY WHEN A PART WAS ACTUALLY ASKED FOR. This gate used to read
      `If Target > 0`, and Target is never below 1, so the step-and-verify
      ran on EVERY lookup including the plain by-name one. When the editor
      reported a part id that was readable but not 1, the walk failed and
      this returned Nil, so a component that demonstrably existed came back
      as "not found".

      MEASURED: lib_link_footprint and lib_batch_rename both refused
      SWEEP_SYM_A and SWEEP_SYM_C while lib_get_component_details and
      lib_get_pin_list resolved the same names in the same session, because
      those two go straight to GetState_SchComponentByLibRef and never step.

      The GH #11 protection is about a caller asking for part 3 and being
      answered about part 1. That only arises when a part was named, which
      is what PartId > 1 means. A single-part lookup has nothing to verify.

              reached still leaves the editor somewhere other than where it
              started, and this build cannot read back where that is. Left
              unsaid it compounds badly: the caller does not know which part
              is showing, and scope @1 is the one suffix that cannot be

                  This used to destroy the iterator first, on the reasoning
                  that a closed iterator cannot have its walk disturbed by
                  the removal. It cannot, but that was never the risk:
                  GroupIterator_Destroy releases what the iterator handed
                  out, so Prim was dangling by the time it was removed, and
                  the engine died on a null read inside
                  ScriptingSystem.DLL. An access violation in the DLL is
                  not something the Try below can catch, so the whole
                  polling loop went with it.

                  Removing here is safe because the walk STOPS at the first
                  match: the Break above means NextPCBObject is never called
                  again on this iterator, so the skip-entries problem that
                  the one-match-per-pass design exists to avoid cannot
                  arise. The outer loop takes a fresh iterator for the next
