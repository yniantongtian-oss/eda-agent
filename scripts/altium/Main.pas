      polling loop with it because undeclared identifiers are not
      catchable and the Try/Except around it did nothing. One caller sat
      on that dialog for over two minutes.

      The property itself is fine. ScanLibForComponent reads it off
      every component it walks, ten lines earlier in the same lookup,
      and has always worked. What differs is the reference: this one is
      held ACROSS commands, and the document it belongs to may have been
      closed, reopened or re-imported since. A member read on a
      component that no longer exists is reported as an undeclared
      identifier rather than as a missing object, which is why it reads
      as an API error and is not one.

      So the reference is cleared whenever this script reopens the
      library, and the name is compared against this recorded string
      rather than against anything read back off the component. }

      MEASURED: EFCreateError, "Cannot create file ... because it is
      being used by another process", arrived as a modal and stalled the
      polling loop. The retry below cannot help with that, because the
      engine surfaces the exception before the surrounding Try/Except
      runs, so the first failure is already a modal. Same behaviour that
      defeated Try/Except around StrToFloat, same answer: stop the
      exception happening rather than trying to catch it.

      FileExists and DeleteFile return Booleans and do not raise, so this
      loop is safe no matter who holds the file. Only once the name is
      free is the raising create attempted.

      tmp + RenameFile would be the tidier fix and is ruled out: the
      sibling implementation in reference/CoAltium records that
      DelphiScript's RenameFile silently failed for some paths and the
      response never reached its final filename.

      This does not make a create infallible. A fresh name can still be
      grabbed between the check and the create, by a virus scanner most
      likely. It removes the reported case, which is a create against a
      name that is already there and already held. }
