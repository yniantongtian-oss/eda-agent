"""Invoke ANY Altium menu command, by path, when nothing scriptable will.

THIS IS THE ONE PLACE THAT SYNTHESISES REAL INPUT. Everywhere else in
this package addresses messages to a specific window handle, so nothing
depends on focus, z-order or where the pointer is. That property cannot
be kept here, and every step below exists because the safer one was
tried against a live Altium and did nothing:

  application.execute_menu     reports success and invokes nothing, for
                               MAPPED paths too. RunProcess silently
                               ignores ids it does not know and cannot
                               report failure (task #83)
  GetMenu on the main frame    returns 0. Altium draws menus with
                               DevExpress bars: no menu ids, no
                               WM_COMMAND route
  accDoDefaultAction           returns cleanly and raises no popup, on
                               bar items AND on submenu items. The bars
                               expose MSAA READ-ONLY: names and
                               rectangles yes, actions no
  posted WM_LBUTTONDOWN/UP     ignored by the bar, unlike Altium's
                               TXPBitBtn which accepts it
  a REAL click                 WORKS, at every level. The popup arrives
                               as a TxpBarSubMenuControl whose items ARE
                               exposed accessibly, so each level is
                               found BY NAME and clicked at its own
                               rectangle

Names, never positions: entries move with context and separators are
not exposed at all, so an index would select the wrong thing the first
time a menu changed.

BECAUSE IT STEALS FOCUS, IT IS NOT A DEFAULT ANYWHERE. A caller asks for
it explicitly, and should not while the user is typing.

EVERY EVENT HERE IS GUARDED. A click or keystroke is delivered to
whatever is active when it fires, so windows.require_foreground runs
immediately before each one and coordinates are confined to Altium's own
windows. Turn the whole thing off with EDA_AGENT_UI_AUTOMATION=0. The
risks and the reasons are in docs/ui-automation.md.

ONE THING IT CANNOT DO SAFELY. Altium's bar carries entries that are
COMMANDS rather than menus, and nothing tells them apart: measured
across all 17, identical MSAA state including HASPOPUP, identical
accDefaultAction, identical UIA control type. Listing such an entry
clicks it, and clicking it runs it.
