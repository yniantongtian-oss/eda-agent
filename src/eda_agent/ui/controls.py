"""Read and SET the controls inside an Altium dialog.

Buttons were the easy half: a dialog is only fully drivable when its
checkboxes, radios, fields and lists can be inspected and changed.

WHAT MAKES THIS POSSIBLE. Altium's VCL controls are opaque to plain
Win32 (a TXPCheckBox is not the stock "Button" class, so BM_GETCHECK
tells you nothing), but they ARE described accessibly. MEASURED on the
Update From Library wizard:

  TXPCheckBox    'Update To Latest Revision'  role=checkbox     value='Checked'
  TXPRadioButton 'Fully replace symbols ...'  role=radiobutton  value='Checked'
  TXPComboBox    'All Components'             role=combobox     value='All Components'
  TdxTreeList    ''                           role=list         value='Grid_Sheets'

So STATE is read from MSAA, which is reliable, and CHANGE is made by
clicking, which is the only thing these controls answer to. Every
setter then READS THE STATE BACK and reports whether it took, because a
click that silently did nothing is the failure mode that matters: it
would leave a caller believing a setting was applied.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT GUESSED. A control reporting 'unavailable' is
refused rather than clicked; Altium greys options that do not apply to
the current selection, and clicking one is at best a no-op. Grids are
readable and selectable by row text, but their cells are not editable
from here, which is stated rather than papered over.
