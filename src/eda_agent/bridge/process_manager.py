# Seeing the Windows process table from WSL.
#
# Under WSL the server runs in its own PID namespace. The Toolhelp scan below
# is Windows-only and answers None here, and psutil enumerates the LINUX
# namespace, which the Windows desktop Altium is not in and never will be. So
# the check that gates every send_command answered "not running" about a
# process it had no way to see, and every call was refused while the polling
# loop was healthy and answering. Reported in GH #32 with a working diagnosis.
#
# tasklist.exe reports the Windows process list and is reachable over WSL
# interop. MEASURED 2026-09-20 on Ubuntu-24.04: interop is NOT always there.
# With systemd enabled, binfmt_misc can come up with no WSLInterop entry, and
# then every Windows binary fails with "Exec format error" even though /mnt/c
# holds them and WSL_INTEROP is set in the environment. So interop is a fast
# path when present, never the thing correctness rests on, and that
# environment variable is not a usable probe for it: only running something
# tells you.
