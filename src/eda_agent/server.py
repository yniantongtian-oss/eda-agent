#
# tool_catalog and tool_guide only help a caller who thinks to call them,

# capability was reported ABSENT while the tool existed under another
# namespace, four times over. A tool description cannot fix that, because
# it is read only once the right tool has already been found. Server
# instructions are the one piece of text a client sees before choosing
# anything, so the pointer belongs here.
#
# Deliberately short. This is prepended to a client's context on every
# session, so it earns its place by covering the mistakes that actually
# happened and nothing else.
#: The schematic-engine paragraph, per backend, because the tools it
#: names are not the same on each. The Altium surface carries the whole
#: family; EasyEDA carries the plan-building half and emits through its
#: own tool; KiCad carries neither, so it gets no paragraph rather than
#: a paragraph naming tools that are not there. A preamble that names a
#: missing tool is read first and trusted most, which is the worst place
#: for a dead end.
