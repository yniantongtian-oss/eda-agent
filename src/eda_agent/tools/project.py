        ``save=True`` (default) writes this project's modified documents,
        then closes it. ``save=False`` closes it without saving.

        WITHOUT SAVING, TWO LAYERS KEEP THE BRIDGE FROM WEDGING. A close
        with a modified member raises Altium's save prompt inside the
        polling loop, where the bridge cannot answer it. MEASURED on AD
        26.10.1.6: after an edit IServerDocument.Modified reads False while
        the tab shows the sheet modified, so nothing gated on that read
        works.

        First, the handler clears the modified flag on every loaded member
        without reading it. MEASURED on a local scratch project: the close
        then raised no prompt and the file on disk was byte-identical.

        Second, if a prompt appears anyway, this answers it through UI
        Automation: "Save None", then "OK" once the dialog has retitled to
        "Confirm Not Saving", which is what shows the decisions changed.
        Pressing OK before that would save. The sequence was measured by
        hand; this tool running it has not run live.

        ALTIUM CLOSES THE FOCUSED PROJECT. MEASURED: a close naming a
        project with no loaded document, while another project's board was
        focused, closed that other project first. So the handler makes the
        named project focused by showing one of its loaded documents, and
        refuses, changing nothing, when it cannot. Every attempt compares
        the open projects before and after: if anything else closed, it
        stops without retrying and returns those paths as
        ``closed_instead``, with ``success`` false.

        IT ANSWERS ONLY FOR THIS PROJECT. It records the project's member
        paths before closing and reads every path the prompt lists. If any
        listed document is outside the project it presses nothing and
        returns them, because answering would discard work in a project
        nobody named. It also presses nothing when membership cannot be
        established: no ``project_path``, or a deployed script that
        reports member file names rather than paths.

        A document shared with another open project is a member of both,
        so its unsaved edits are discarded here too. ``save=True`` prompts
        are never answered for you.

        IF A PROMPT IS LEFT OPEN, answer it with ``app_invoke_element``
        (``Save None``, then ``OK``) or ``app_press_dialog_button``. Both
        work while the bridge is blocked, because they go through Win32
        rather than through the loop.

        Args:
            project_path: project to close. Omit for the focused project;
                ``save=False`` then leaves any prompt for a human.
            save: write modified documents first (True), or discard their
                unsaved edits (False).

        Returns:
            ``success`` and ``closed``, checked by looking the project up
            again, and ``project_path``. When a prompt was answered,
            ``prompts_answered`` and ``discarded``, the paths it listed.
            When one was left, ``prompt`` and ``reason``: the bridge stays
            blocked until it is answered. Without a prompt, ``discarded``
            lists the loaded members closed without saving and
            ``attempts`` how many closes it took. The modified flag cannot
            be read reliably, so a path in ``discarded`` is not proof that
            document had edits.

        large wall-time sink, especially with `with_pin_nets=True`
        because each call compiles the project.

        Performance note: pin nets are the only field that needs a
        project compile, and a stale-cache compile on a multi-sheet
        hierarchical project can take 30-60s. When you only need the

        pin numbers/names (no nets), pass ``with_pin_nets=False`` and

        entirely. Use the default ``with_pin_nets=True`` only when you
        actually need to know what each pin is wired to.

        ``with_parameters=False`` further skips the parameter iterator
        (Manufacturer / MPN / Value / Footprint paths). Marginal win
        compared to skipping the compile, but useful for the cheapest
        possible "is this designator placed?" probe.

        ``timeout`` overrides the bridge's default poll timeout. The
        compile-bound full-fat call can legitimately need 60-90s on
        large projects, raise this when you keep `with_pin_nets=True`.

        DATASHEET DISCIPLINE: Before making any claim about this

        NOT authoritative, only the manufacturer datasheet is.
        `_datasheet_guidance` in the response carries the rule and a

            designator: Component designator (e.g., "U1", "R8", "C3")

        The server:
          1. Compiles the project and records before-state mappings
             (matched, extra-in-schematic, extra-in-pcb).
          2. Invokes ``WorkspaceManager:Compare`` (ObjectKind=Project,
             Action=UpdateOther): the evidenced scriptable sch→PCB update.
             The modal ECO dialog opens here.
          3. After the user accepts, recompiles and reports the after-state
             delta (how many components were added/removed).

        Refuses with WRONG_FOCUS while a schematic is the active document.
        MEASURED 2026-08-17: Altium answers the compare with a modal reading
        "Cannot compare a source document against its owner project" and
        changes nothing, and this tool used to report success anyway, three
        times in a row, with the error still on screen. Focus the PCB with
        ``app_set_active_document`` first.

        What the result does NOT tell you: whether the dialog was accepted.
        ``dialog_outcome_verified`` is always false, because the handler
        returns as soon as the modal closes and cannot see which button was
        pressed. ``components_added_to_pcb`` and its siblings are recounts,
        so they catch a change in component PRESENCE and miss everything
        else an ECO carries: footprint swaps, designator and parameter
        edits, net changes. Unchanged counts therefore mean "nothing was
        added or removed", not "nothing happened". To learn what the dialog
        actually says, call ``app_list_open_dialogs``, which reads Altium
        over Win32 and so answers while the modal is blocking the bridge.

        For unattended board population without a schematic, use
        ``pcb_place_components`` instead (places geometry only: see its note
        about leaving the project unsynced).

        Returns:
            Dictionary with success, pcb_path, before/after mapping counts,
            components_added_to_pcb, components_removed_from_pcb,
            components_in_sync (component presence only, see above), and
            dialog_outcome_verified.
