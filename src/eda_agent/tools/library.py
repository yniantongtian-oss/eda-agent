            size: Text height in mils. 50 is a common silkscreen size;
                drop to 30-40 for tight footprints.

                ``audit_find_mirrored_pcb_text`` reports both halves of

        tallest 3D body and write its ``OverallHeight`` to
        ``Footprint.Height``.

        Footprint.Height is what Altium's placement-collision DRC
        uses to enforce height-clearance rules (don't place a tall
        electrolytic under a low overhang; don't sandwich an LCD
        connector under another PCB in a multi-board stack-up).
        Libraries shipped from vendors without explicit heights default
        to 0 which makes the DRC silently no-op -- a real production
        risk caught only at first-article assembly.

        Args:
            mode: ``raise`` (default) only ever increases a height, so a
                hand-set "I know this part is 5mm despite the model
                being 3mm" survives. ``match`` also LOWERS one to the
                model.

        Reach for ``match`` when heights are too TALL, which raising
        cannot fix and which is the more damaging fault: a footprint
        claiming 50mm when the part is 3mm fails placement-collision
        DRC against everything near it and blocks placements that are
        fine, where a too-low height merely fails to catch a real
        collision. To correct one footprint, or one with no model at
        all, use ``lib_set_footprint_height``.

        Safety:
          - NEITHER MODE WRITES ZERO. A footprint with no 3D body
            yields no measurement, and writing the 0 that implies would
            silently disable the very DRC rule this arms. Those come
            back as ``without_model`` with their names.
          - Does NOT save the library; review the ``items[]`` diff and
            save in Altium.

        a footprint carrying an absurd height could be read and not

        WHY TOO TALL IS WORSE THAN TOO SHORT. Footprint.Height drives
        placement-collision DRC. A footprint claiming 50mm when the part

        that are fine. A too-low height only fails to catch a real

        """Get all components in a library.

        Default fast path returns only the metadata that the
        ``ILibCompInfoReader`` exposes directly: name, alias_name,
        part_count, description. That path scales linearly with file IO
        and finishes in well under a second on typical libraries.

        Setting ``with_parameters=True`` adds each component's full
        parameter dict (Manufacturer, Value, Footprint, etc.) to the
        result. That branch calls ``GetState_SchComponentByLibRef`` once
        per symbol and iterates parameters, which is O(N) in the live
        SchLib document and is what makes the call slow on libraries
        with many hundreds of components. Use it when you need the
        parameters; for a single symbol's parameters, prefer
        ``lib_get_component_details``.

        Setting ``with_designator=True`` adds each component's DEFAULT
        designator (``Component.Designator.Text``, e.g. ``"U?"`` / ``"R?"``
        / ``"IC?"``). The CompInfoReader fast path does NOT expose the
        designator, so this also loads each live symbol (same cost driver
        as with_parameters) but skips parameter iteration, keeping the
        payload small. Intended for library-wide designator-consistency
        audits.

        Args:
            library_path: Path to library (uses active library if not specified)
            with_parameters: If True, include each component's parameter
                dict (slow on large libraries). Default False.
            with_designator: If True, include each component's default
                designator string (slow on large libraries; smaller
                payload than with_parameters). Default False.

        ``part_count`` HERE IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY. It comes from the
        CompInfoReader, and MEASURED on AD26 it reported 2 for a symbol
        created single-part whose every pin carries OwnerPartId 1, while
        ``lib_get_component_details`` reported 1 for an identically
        created symbol. The two readers disagree and only the
        discrepancy is established, not a conversion between them, so
        no correction is applied here rather than guess one. Use
        ``lib_get_component_details`` when the part count matters.

        Returns:
            Dictionary with ``count`` and ``components`` list. Each
            component carries index, name, alias_name, part_count,
            description, (only when with_parameters is True) parameters,
            and (only when with_designator is True) designator.

            ``index`` is a stable addressing key (position in library
            order). Pass it as ``component_index`` to lib_get_component_details
            / lib_delete_component / lib_rename_component to reach a
            component whose ``name`` contains bytes you cannot reproduce
            (an embedded double-quote, or a control char from a broken
            import), the case where matching by name fails.

        WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN THE pcb_* LAYER TOOLS. Those act on
        whichever board is current, and pointing them at a particular
        library depends on the focus actually moving. When it does not
        they operate on the previously focused library while reporting
        success: a sweep over twenty one libraries returned twenty one
        identical answers because every call had re-read the same file.

        This takes the library by PATH and refuses unless the document
        that ended up focused is the one asked for. Acting on the wrong
        library is worse than not acting, because it looks like it
        worked.

        Every change is READ BACK. A layer whose name, enable or kind did
        not take is reported against that layer rather than folded into
        an overall pass.

        PAIRED KINDS. Any kind ending in Top or Bottom is held by the
        layer PAIR rather than by either layer, under a shorter name with
        the side dropped, so "Courtyard Top" is stored as the pair kind
        "Courtyard". Assigning one therefore needs BOTH sides in the same
        call: give the partner kind to another layer in ``layers`` and
        the two are joined and the pair given the kind. Single kinds such
        as "Fab Notes" need no partner.

        Pair with ``lib_run_across`` to apply the same layer scheme to
        many libraries in a single call.

        Args:
            layers: One dict per layer. Keys: ``layer`` (required, e.g.
                "Mechanical13"), and any of ``name``, ``enabled``
                (bool), ``kind`` (e.g. "Courtyard Top"). A layer with
                none of the three is reported as nothing asked for.
            library_path: The library to edit. Defaults to the focused
                document, which is only safe for a single library.
            tidy_pairs: Remove layer pairs no kind justifies. Altium
                never drops a pair when a kind moves to other layers, so
                a library reworked more than once accumulates pairs the
                Layer Stack Manager still shows. A pair survives the
                tidy only when its two layers carry kinds that are each
                other's opposite side. Off by default, because it
                REMOVES pairs and a caller renaming one layer should not
                have the stack rearranged underneath.

        Sweeping libraries one at a time costs a round trip and a turn of

        request and loops inside Altium.

        WHAT THIS DOES NOT SAVE. Opening and saving each library, which is
        the larger cost and is unavoidable. The saving is the round trips
        and the waiting between them, which is what makes a twenty
        library sweep tedious rather than slow.

        ``link_3d_model`` and the rest) act on whichever library is open
        and cannot be swept, because focusing the document is the work.

        FAILURE IS PER LIBRARY. One library that will not open does not
        abandon the rest, and the reply reports each library separately
        rather than as a single flag. "17 of 20 worked" collapses into
        either a false clean or a false failure the moment it becomes one

        Closes the gap that made KiCad-format part sources useless on
        the Altium side: this server could export Altium to KiCad but
        had no path back, so a hit from a KiCad registry or from the
        local KiCad libraries (see ``part_search``) was a dead end.

        Parses into the SAME neutral model the EasyEDA importer uses, so
        the Altium plan is produced by one shared emitter rather than a
        second copy that would drift from it.

        Give ``symbol_path``, ``footprint_path``, or both. Use
        ``symbol_name`` to pick one symbol out of a multi-symbol library
        (the first is used otherwise).

        MULTI-PART COMPONENTS: a quad gate or dual op-amp converts in
        ONE call to a real Altium multi-part symbol (``part_count`` plus
        per-pin ``owner_part_id``), not to N symbols to merge by hand.
        Set ``unit`` to a positive number to convert only that sub-part
        instead. Units are never merged into a flat symbol: they share
        coordinates by design, so a merged symbol has every unit's pins
        stacked on the same points and still looks converted.

        HIDDEN PINS: kept, and kept hidden. A hidden pin is
        electrically real (this is how symbols carry supply rails and
        no-connects), so dropping it would lose a pin while showing it
        would clutter the symbol.

        DERIVED SYMBOLS: over half of KiCad's standard entries carry no
        geometry of their own and inherit it from a parent. That link is
        followed, and ``warnings`` says where the geometry came from.

        target="altium": returns an ORDERED PLAN of this server's own
        library tools, exactly like lib_easyeda_import. Nothing is

        is given; they are never blanked. Get the exact string from a
        known-good model first (see lib_set_model_source).

        Note: it preserves what is present; it cannot resurrect data a prior
        broken run already dropped. If a library was damaged by an earlier
        version, restore the backup and run this on it.

        If you are also renaming footprint entities, run lib_rename_footprint
