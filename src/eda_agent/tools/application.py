                ``offline`` needs no Altium at all; ``simulator`` is
                bridge-backed but every command it sends is implemented
                by the in-repo Altium simulator; ``live_only`` sends at

        and individually unasked for:

        * **Which document is focused, and what kind it is.** Nearly
          every tool acts on the focused document. A pcb_ tool aimed
          while a library is focused does not always fail; it can resolve
          some other open document and report success for work you did
          not ask for.
        * **Whether the running script matches the one on disk.**
          DelphiScript caches compiled units, so a deployed fix does
          nothing until the script project is reopened. Symptom: a fix
          that "did not work".
        * **What is unsaved.** An edit that is real in memory and absent
          from disk reads as a tool that silently did nothing.
        * **Whether the bridge is answering at all**, as opposed to
          Altium being up.

        This composes existing reads rather than adding a bridge call, so
        it is cheap and cannot disagree with the tools it summarises.

        WHAT IT DOES NOT TELL YOU: which library component is current.
        That is editor state with no read exposed, and the library
        authoring tools depend on it. If a lib_add_* call lands somewhere
        unexpected, set the target explicitly with
        ``lib_set_current_component`` rather than assuming.

        This sends the command and cannot tell you it ran. Altium's
        ``RunProcess`` accepts an unknown process id in silence and
        reports nothing back, so a typo, a command unavailable in the
        current editor, and a command that worked are indistinguishable
        from here. MEASURED 2026-08-17: "Tools|Preferences" returned in
        0.11s with ``success: true`` and no dialog ever appeared. That is
        why the reply says ``dispatched``, never ``executed``, and carries
        ``outcome_verified: false``.

        Use ``app_click_menu`` when you need the command to actually
        happen. It walks the real menu bar and clicks the item, so it
        fails loudly on a path that does not exist and reaches the many
        commands that have no process id at all.

        These paths are mapped to internal processes:
        - "File|Save All"
        - "Tools|Design Rule Check"
        - "Tools|Electrical Rules Check"
        - "Project|Compile"
        - "Edit|Select All" / "Edit|Deselect All"
        - "View|Zoom Fit"
        - "Tools|Preferences"
        - "Tools|Extensions and Updates"

        Anything else is REFUSED with UNMAPPED_MENU_PATH. The old
        fallback guessed a MenuID out of the pipe-separated path and was
        measured opening nothing while reporting success, so refusing
        and pointing at ``app_click_menu`` is strictly more useful than
        a guess that cannot work.

            menu_path: Menu path using pipe separators (e.g., "File|Save All")
