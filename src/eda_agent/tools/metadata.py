"""Out-of-band metadata for the MCP tool surface.

FastMCP (mcp 1.5.x, pinned <2) has no ``tags``/``annotations`` field on its
tool model, so tool metadata cannot ride on the ``@mcp.tool()`` decorator.
This module keeps a decorator-independent registry instead, keyed by tool
name, that other layers consume:

- the future discovery layer (a ``tool_catalog`` meta-tool) filters by
  ``category`` / ``interaction`` so a client need not load 345 schemas;
- the docs generator groups by ``category`` and badges by ``maturity``;
- a CI drift test asserts every registered tool resolves here and that no
  override names a tool that no longer exists.

Three axes:

``category`` -- derived from the name prefix; 100% mechanical.

``maturity`` -- how well the tool is verified.
    ``offline``    pure Python, deterministic, fully covered by CI unit
                   tests; never touches Altium.
    ``simulator``  bridge-backed, and EVERY command it sends is
                   implemented by the in-repo Python Altium simulator, so
                   the whole call can be driven in CI with no Altium.
    ``live_only``  bridge-backed, and at least one command it sends has
                   no simulator handler; verifiable only against a real
                   Altium session.
  ``simulator`` is measured against the simulator itself rather than
  estimated, and a guard test fails if the two disagree. Read it as
  "exercisable without Altium", not as "a test exercises it today":
  those are different claims and only the first is enforced here.
  The Phase 1.3 nightly live-run is the intended source of a future
  promotion to a ``verified`` tier; when that lands, record per-tool
  results in ``MATURITY_OVERRIDES``.

``interaction`` -- what running the tool does to the Altium session.
    ``readonly``   queries / reads; no mutation.
    ``silent``     mutates, no dialog -- the loop stays responsive.
    ``modal``      pops a non-suppressible Altium dialog that BLOCKS the
                   polling loop until a human clicks (see the bridge audit).
    ``partial``    succeeds but leaves the job incomplete; a follow-up tool
                   is required to finish.
