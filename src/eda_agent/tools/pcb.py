        opens no dialog and cannot block the bridge. Use it as the
        default way to inspect violations.

        It used to trigger ``PCB:DesignRuleCheck`` first, which raises
        Altium's MODAL "Design Rule Checker" setup dialog: on a
        241-component board that wedged the whole bridge for 30+ min
        until the client timed out. A "get" tool must not do that, so
        the trigger is gone. ``pcb_run_drc(allow_modal=True)`` is now
        the only way to force a fresh run.

        CAVEAT -- ``violation_count: 0`` means "no violations are
        stored on this board", NOT "the board passes". If DRC has
        never been run in this Altium session, there is nothing to
        read and the answer is 0 either way. The response carries
        ``drc_triggered: false`` and a ``note`` saying so. To get
        fresh data, run DRC from Altium's UI (Tools > Design Rule
        Check) or call ``pcb_run_drc(allow_modal=True)`` and be ready
        to click the dialog.

        Filter is substring-matched against the violation's Description
        and Name, so it catches both "Net USB_DP and Net GND" clearance
        warnings and net-named via antennas.

        Each violation carries ``x_mils`` / ``y_mils`` / ``layer`` for

        DANGER: Altium has no non-interactive DRC trigger exposed to
        DelphiScript. ``PCB:DesignRuleCheck`` raises the MODAL "Design
        Rule Checker [mil]" setup dialog and the worker sits behind it
        until a HUMAN clicks Cancel/OK. Nothing else on the bridge
        runs meanwhile: one observed call left the loop dead for 30+
        min, the client timed out at 1800 s, and every in-flight job
        was stranded. No parameter suppresses the dialog, so this tool
        refuses to fire unless the caller passes ``allow_modal=True``,
        which is a promise that a human is at the keyboard.

        PREFER ``pcb_get_clearance_violations`` -- it reads the
        violations already stored on the board, runs no DRC, and
        cannot block.

        PATHOLOGICAL CASE: a full DRC on a placed-but-unrouted board
        (many components, zero tracks, everything unrouted) checks
        every pad pair against every rule and is enormously slow for
        an answer that is already known -- "nothing is routed yet".
        Check ``pcb_get_board_statistics`` / ``pcb_get_unrouted_nets``
        first; if track count is 0, do not run DRC.

        With ``allow_modal=True`` it executes the DRC and returns up
        to 100 violations with full location data, so the agent can
        jump straight to the offending spot instead of guessing from
        the description.

            centre (the "go here" hint)
          - ``primitive1`` / ``primitive2``: objects with
            ``{detail, type, net, layer, x_mils, y_mils}``. ``type``
            is the object kind (Track / Pad / Via / Region / Comp);
            ``net`` is the net name. Two primitives are involved in
            most rule kinds (Clearance, Short Circuit); a single-
            primitive violation (e.g. AcuteAngle) leaves
            ``primitive2`` with empty fields.

        Use ``primitive1.net`` and ``primitive2.net`` to spot the
        nets in conflict; use ``x_mils`` / ``y_mils`` to drive
        ``proj_cross_probe`` or the dashboard's Drawing tab to the site.

          board-edge, decoupling proximity, connector banding, thermal).
          Best for an unplaced or badly scrambled board. The full
          per-term objective is always returned under ``objective_report``.

        With ``optimize_rotation`` (default on) it also picks each
        eligible part's orientation (0/90/180/270) to point its pins at
        the nets they connect -- the classic auto-place win for 2-pin
        passives. This needs per-pin geometry, so the tool also reads the
        board's pads and maps them to components; orientation is only
        considered for top-side parts currently sitting at an orthogonal
        angle (others keep their rotation).

        Workflow: call once with ``apply=False`` (default), read the
        ``hpwl_improvement_pct`` and ``overlap_pairs_after``, eyeball the
        ``moves``, then call again with ``apply=True`` to commit them in
        one ``pcb.batch_move_components`` transaction. Components on
        opposite layers may share an X/Y footprint (they cannot
        physically collide).

        Seeding: by default the solver refines the board's CURRENT
        positions (small, sensible nudges). Pass ``reseed_grid=True`` for
        a from-scratch re-place (ignores current positions) -- use only
        on an unplaced or badly-scrambled board.

        Args:
            designators: If given, ONLY these components are moved; every
                other placed component is held fixed but still attracts
                its nets and blocks overlaps. If omitted, all components
                are candidates (minus ``fixed``).
            fixed: Designators to pin in place (connectors, mounting
                holes, anything already positioned). Naming-agnostic --
                you choose which; the tool does not guess by prefix.
            region: Placement bounds ``{x1, y1, x2, y2}`` in mils. If
                omitted, the board outline's bounding rectangle is used.
            iterations: Global-placement relaxation steps (default 400).
                More iterations = better convergence, longer runtime.
            grid_mils: Snap grid for final positions (default 5).
            clearance_mils: Extra copper-to-copper breathing room added
                to each pair's half-extents (default 15).
            max_net_fanout: Skip nets touching more than this many
                components (default 0 = keep all). Set e.g. 20 to ignore
                power/ground planes that do not usefully guide placement.
            exclude_nets: Explicit net names to ignore (e.g. ``["GND"]``).
            critical_nets: Net names to treat as placement-critical (e.g. a
                clock, a high-speed pair, a sensitive analog feedback line).
                Their pull is scaled by ``critical_weight`` so the solver
                keeps their endpoints close and shortens those traces first,
                at a small cost to ordinary nets. You (the planner) decide
                which nets matter; the tool does not guess by name.
            critical_weight: Multiplier applied to ``critical_nets`` pull
                (default 3.0, clamped to [1, 20]). Higher = more aggressive
                shortening of the critical nets versus the rest.
            edge_parts: ``{refdes: band}`` mapping parts that must sit on a
                board EDGE to which edge -- ``"L"``/``"R"``/``"T"``/``"B"``
                (left/right/top/bottom). The solver seats each against that
                edge (centred on the free axis) and holds it there. Use for
                connectors, mounting holes, USB/headers -- anything needing
                cable or panel access. You (the planner) decide which; the
                tool does not guess by designator prefix.
            keepout_groups: ``{refdes: group}`` mixed-signal separation tags.
                Parts in DIFFERENT groups are pushed apart (the
                industrial-engineering "undesirable adjacency" relationship)
                -- segregate a noisy switching / digital section from a
                sensitive analog / RF one. The group string is opaque (only
                equality matters); you (the planner) assign the domains
                semantically. ``construct`` engine only. Separating the groups
                usually also shortens wirelength by de-interleaving them.
            match_groups: ``{refdes: group}`` matched-pair keep-together tags.
                Parts in the SAME group are pulled ADJACENT even when they
                share no net -- the absolutely-necessary-adjacency relationship
                / analog common-centroid matching (a differential pair's two
                input resistors, a current mirror, a matched array). HPWL only
                co-locates parts that share a net; this co-locates matched ones
                that don't. ``construct`` engine only.
            match_roles: ``{refdes: role}`` common-centroid sub-device labels
                WITHIN a match_group (e.g. ``A``/``B`` for the two matched
                halves of a cross-quad or interdigitated array). The optimiser
                drives each role's centroid onto a common point so a linear
                process/thermal gradient cancels -- it picks the balanced
                ABBA/ABAB arrangement that ``match_groups`` alone (which only
                keeps the cells compact) cannot distinguish from an unbalanced
                AABB. Only meaningful with >= 2 roles per group and >= 2 cells
                per role; needs ``match_groups`` set too. ``construct`` only.
            plan_json: The DesignPlan (JSON string or dict) you authored. When
                given, the placer auto-derives matched-pair ``match_groups``
                from differential nets and analog/digital ``keepout_groups``
                from the plan's net roles, and MERGES them under the explicit
                ``match_groups`` / ``keepout_groups`` args (explicit wins per
                refdes). No-op for a plan with no differential / mixed-signal
                structure. What was inferred is echoed in ``auto_constraints``.
            reseed_grid: Re-place from a fresh grid instead of refining
                current positions (default False).
            optimize_rotation: Also choose part orientation to shorten
                pin-level wirelength (default True). Set False to keep
                every part's current rotation.
            engine: ``"refine"`` (default, nudge current positions) or
                ``"construct"`` (from-scratch placement). ``"construct"``
                implies a from-scratch re-place regardless of
                ``reseed_grid``.
            restarts: ``"construct"`` engine only. When > 1, run that many
                seeded restarts and keep the lowest-objective legal
                placement (variance reduction at a cost linear in
                ``restarts``). Default 1 (single deterministic run).
            render_png: Optional file path. When set, also render a preview
                image of the proposed placement (board outline, courtyards,
                net stars) to that path and return it as ``preview_png``
                (offline, matplotlib). Rendering never breaks the move data;
                failures surface as ``preview_error``.
            apply: When True, commit the moves to the board. Default
                False (dry-run).

        Returns:
            Dict with:
              - ``dry_run``: bool (True unless ``apply`` and moves exist)
              - ``engine``: the solver core used

              - ``pin_count`` (pads mapped to components for rotation)
              - ``summary``: a one-line plain-language assessment synthesising
                legality, utilization, signal routability, decoupling, and the
                suggested board size -- read this first to judge the placement
              - ``hpwl_before``, ``hpwl_after``, ``hpwl_improvement_pct``
              - ``overlap_pairs_before``, ``overlap_pairs_after``
              - ``objective_report``: every objective term un-weighted
                (``hpwl``, ``via``, ``cong``, ``clear``, ``edge``,
                ``decap``, ``conn``, ``therm``) plus ``weighted_total``,
                ``legal``, and ``utilization`` for the proposed layout
              - ``net_length_report``: ``longest_nets`` (the few nets with
                the largest physical bounding span in mils -- the routing
                risk, and the candidates to mark ``critical_nets``) plus
                ``critical_net_spans`` echoing the achieved span of each
                net you flagged critical, so you can confirm it paid off
              - ``ratsnest``: routability / via-pressure indicator from the
                straight-line MST of each net. ``signal_crossings`` (rails
                above ``signal_fanout_cap`` pins excluded, since planes carry
                no signal via) predicts routing difficulty -- different-net
                MST edges that cross need a layer change; ``total_crossings``
                is the conservative all-net count
              - ``decoupling_report``: the engine's structural decoupling
                analysis -- a list of ``{decap, ic, distance_mils}`` (worst
                first) naming which cap decouples which IC (found on the
                connectivity graph, never by reference) and how close it
                landed to the served power pin. Empty when no decoupling is
                structurally identifiable
              - ``suggested_board``: for the ``construct`` engine, the board
                rectangle it sized and tightened to the placement
                (``{x1, y1, x2, y2, width, height}`` in mils) -- the "best
                PCB size" recommendation. ``null`` for the ``refine`` engine,
                which works inside the existing outline
              - ``moved_count``, ``rotated_count`` and ``moves`` (each
                ``{designator, from: {x, y, rotation}, to: {x, y,
                rotation}}`` in mils/degrees; ``to.rotation`` is null
                when the orientation was unchanged)
              - ``region`` used, ``notes`` from the solver, and
                ``apply_result`` when ``apply=True``.

        Where ``pcb_copy_component_placement`` only relocates components,

        polygons, regions, fills -- onto the destination group and remaps

        destination net. The classic multi-channel "lay out channel 1,
        replicate to channels 2..N" workflow, end to end.

        Positioning: one rigid transform is derived from the FIRST mapping
        pair (the anchor) -- the copied routing is rotated by
        ``dstRot - srcRot`` about the source anchor, then translated by

        (a shared GND / power pour) are deliberately left alone. Pass an
        explicit ``nets`` list to override and copy exactly those.

        Preconditions: the destination components must already be placed
        congruently with the source (e.g. run

        Pure math, no Altium hit -- safe to call without an attached

        of several temperature rises (1, 5, 10, 20, 30 °C above
        ambient), plus DC resistance if a length is supplied.

        Formula (IPC-2221, also IPC-2152's curve-fit predecessor):
          ``I = k × (ΔT)^0.44 × (h × w)^0.725``

          ``k = 0.048`` for external layers (top, bottom)
          ``k = 0.024`` for internal layers (mid)
        Internal-layer derating is the dominant correction; running a
        signal that draws 5 A on TopLayer might be fine but on an
        inner plane the same width only handles ~3 A at the same
        ΔT because heat dissipates more slowly.

        Copper thickness conversion: 1 oz/ft² ≈ 1.378 mils. So
        ``copper_oz=1.0`` → ``h = 1.378 mils``, ``copper_oz=2.0`` →
        ``h = 2.756 mils``.

        Resistance: ``R = ρ × L / (h × w)`` with ρ = 6.7 × 10⁻⁷ Ω-mil
        (annealed copper, 25 °C). Multiply current × resistance to
        get voltage drop across the track.

        """Suppress stencil paste on Not-Fitted (DNP) components.

        The remediation half of ``audit_variant_not_fitted``. A Not-Fitted
        component is on the BOM as a placeholder and must NOT receive
        paste: the SMT line would otherwise deposit paste on empty pads,
        and the bridging that follows shows up as rework.

        With no ``designators`` this asks ``audit_variant_not_fitted``
        for the components Not Fitted in the project's CURRENT variant,
        so the selection follows the variant you actually have open.
        Pass an explicit list to override that.

        Mechanism: each surface pad gets a manual PasteMaskExpansion of
        minus its larger dimension, which collapses the stencil aperture
        whatever the pad shape. Through-hole pads are left alone and
        counted separately, since they have no aperture to suppress.

        Reversible: ``restore=True`` discards the manual override so
        Altium recomputes the expansion from the design rules.

        RESTORE THE SAME LIST YOU APPLIED. ``restore`` will NOT guess:
        called without ``designators`` it refuses and tells you what to
        pass. That is deliberate. Resolving a restore from the current
        variant means excluding under one variant, switching, then
        restoring, and leaving any component that was excluded but is
        fitted in the new variant with its aperture still suppressed.
        Nothing would report it: the call succeeds, the pad looks
        ordinary in the editor, and the part comes back from assembly
        unsoldered.

        The apply reply lists every component it touched in ``items``.
        Pass those designators back to restore. If you really do want
        the current variant's Not-Fitted list, ask for it with
        ``use_current_variant=True`` and you own the choice.

        Apply is unaffected: with no ``designators`` it uses the current
        variant's Not-Fitted list, which is the whole point of applying.

        Mismatch is visible either way. ``components_requested`` versus
        ``components_matched`` in the reply reports how many of the
        names you passed were actually found on this board.

        Args:
            designators: Components to treat. Omit on an apply to use
                the current variant's Not-Fitted list. Required on a
                restore unless ``use_current_variant`` is set.
            restore: Undo a previous exclusion instead of applying one.
            dry_run: Report which components WOULD be treated and change
                nothing. Worth using first: this edits the board, and a
                wrong variant selection would strip paste off parts that
                are meant to be fitted.

                Bumped up in 5-mil steps if coverage % is below

                ``"solder_mask_expansion"`` - The mask opening at each pad
                    and via site (value = radial expansion in mils,
                    SIGNED). A negative value contracts the opening,

                    ``"IsVia"`` to tent vias and leave pads alone.
                ``"paste_mask_expansion"`` - Same shape, stencil side
                    (value = radial expansion in mils, signed).

                    via inside an SMD pad. Boolean: set ``allowed``, not
                    ``value``. This is the DRC that catches via-in-pad,
                    which needs filling and capping at fabrication.
            value: Rule's primary value in mils. For width / via_size /
                differential_pairs this is the MIN side. Default 10.
            max_value: For width / via_size / differential_pairs. When
                supplied, sets the MAX side independently of value. When
                None, falls back to 5x value (legacy default).
            favored_value: For width / differential_pairs. Sets the
                preferred value. Defaults to value when None.
            max_uncoupled_length: For differential_pairs only.
                MaxUncoupledLength in mils (single scalar, not per-layer).
                Defaults to 1000 mils when None.
            scope: Optional query expression for Scope1. Pick the
                predicate that matches the rule kind:
                  - net-based rules (clearance, width, via_size):
                    ``"InNet('GND')"``, ``"InNetClass('Power')"``,

                    ``"InDifferentialPairClass('HighSpeed')"``,
                    ``"IsDifferentialPair"`` (matches any diff pair),
                    or ``"All"``.
                Mixing predicates across kinds (e.g., ``InNet`` on a
                differential_pairs rule) creates a rule that never matches.
            net_scope: Which nets the rule applies between. Options:
                ``"different_nets"`` (default) for Clearance rules;
                ``"any_net"`` for all-pairs; ``"same_net"`` for same-net
                only. Has no effect on differential_pairs, and none on
                the mask or vias_under_smd kinds, which are not
                net-pair rules.
            allowed: For vias_under_smd only. False forbids a via inside
                an SMD pad. Omitted means True, which is Altium's own
                default and creates a rule that changes nothing, rather

        WHY THE DESCRIPTOR AND NOT THE NUMBERS. Constraint values live on

        IPCB_MaxMinWidthConstraint, ...). This handler holds a base
        IPCB_Rule, where those members do not exist, so reading them
        gives nothing and the descriptor is what is offered instead.
        Parse it client-side if you need numeric values.

        THAT IS A LIMIT OF THIS READ, NOT OF THE API, and the difference
        matters because the sentence above has already been read as
        "constraints are unreachable" and stopped someone who then
        reported a rule as unwritable. DelphiScript DOES narrow an
        interface, but only at iterator return, so a typed local
        assigned straight from ``BoardIterator.FirstPCBObject`` reaches
        the constraint members. ``pcb_set_rule_properties`` writes them
        that way. To CHANGE a value, use that tool. ``obj_modify`` will
        not do it: it dispatches through the base reference and reports
        a match while changing nothing.

          HoleToHoleClearance (kind 52) and BoardOutlineClearance
          (kind 63): ``gap_mils``, or ``gap_mm`` when the value is
          metric. An integer mil field cannot express 0.2mm; it lands
          on 8 mils, which is 0.2032mm. Pass one or the other.

          ``favored_width_mils`` (applied to every layer).
        - HoleSize (kind 42): ``min_hole_size_mils`` / ``max_hole_size_mils``.

        THE GAP WRITE IS READ BACK, not assumed. A rule kind that does
        not really carry Gap can accept the assignment and keep its old
        value, so the reply carries ``gap_written``, ``gap_after_mm``
        and, when it did not take, a note saying the rule still holds
        the old number. Kind 63 in particular is included on the
        strength of its position in the TRuleKind order rather than a
        documented interface, so let ``gap_written`` decide whether it
        worked rather than the count.

        Pass only the parameters you want to change; everything else
        stays untouched. Each VERIFIED field write increments
        ``properties_updated`` in the response, so a refused constraint
        no longer inflates it.

        NOTE: Priority is NOT writable from this tool. ``IPCB_Rule.Priority``
        is a read-only function in the PCB scripting API
        (``Function Priority : TRulePrecedence``), not a property; there
        is no ``SetState_Priority`` or ``SetPriority`` method either.
        Assigning to it crashes the DelphiScript engine. To reorder rule
        priorities, drag them in Altium's UI (PCB > Rules and Constraints
        Editor; rules earlier in a category have higher priority).
