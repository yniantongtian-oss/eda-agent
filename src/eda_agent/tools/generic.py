                blank, and that ambiguity has three times been read as

        ``proj_get_nets`` gives the verdict but never the evidence, so a
        surprising net assignment can only be debugged by reconstructing
        Altium's connectivity by hand from raw geometry. This returns the
        evidence directly.

        Reports the pin's ROOT (``Pin.Location``, body side) and its
        CONNECTION point (``Location + PinLength`` along ``Orientation``),
        then lists every schematic object sitting on each point.

        Reading the result:

        - ``at_connection`` is what actually drives the pin's net. Two net
          labels with different ``text`` there is a short between two named
          nets, and the usual symptom is one of them reporting zero pins.
        - ``at_root`` is electrically INERT. A net label there is the
          classic "sheet looks wired but the pin floats on an auto-net" bug.
        - An empty ``at_connection`` with a populated ``at_root`` means the
          label must move by ``pin_length_mils`` along the pin's
          orientation; the target is given as ``connect_x_mils`` /
          ``connect_y_mils``.

        Hits are filtered by the object's Location (or a pin's electrical
        end, or a wire vertex), not by bounding box. Altium's
        ``AddFilter_Area`` matches text boxes, which extend hundreds of
        mils from a net label; without the Location check this tool
        reports labels that are merely nearby.

        different object (different designator, different pin name,
        different sheet). A single `obj_batch_modify` call touches N objects

        difference is typically 10-100x on a multi-item edit.

        Two-step pattern by design: ``proj_run_erc()`` performs the
        compile-and-check (slow, can be 30+ s on a large project);
        this tool reads back the violations cheaply so the agent can
        re-query without re-running ERC.

        Each violation names the OBJECTS it is about, not just a
        category. ``related_objects`` carries one entry per offending
        object with its ``kind`` (Pin, Net, Port), its ``document``, and
        a ``cross_probe`` string, which is what Altium itself uses to
        jump to that exact object and is therefore what identifies the
        specific pin or net.

        That detail is the difference between a report and something
        actionable. A category plus a sheet name cannot be acted on: the
        only safe response to "floating input pin, somewhere on this
        sheet" is to do nothing, because a NoERC marker placed by
        guesswork silently suppresses a real disconnection and is worse
        than the warning it clears.

        ``related_object_count`` is reported separately, so a violation
        that genuinely exposes no objects is distinguishable from one
        whose objects could not be read.

        Schematic mirror of ``pcb_clear_source_footprint_library``. When
        a library is renamed, moved, or consolidated, placed components
        keep pointing at it through two component PROPERTIES:

        - ``SourceLibraryName``: which library file the part came from.
        - ``DesignItemId``: which library ITEM it re-matches against

          updates only LibReference leaves this naming the OLD item,
          which is exactly the ``<Not Found>`` state in the panel.

        Per matching component this clears SourceLibraryName (when set)

        PREFER THIS after running `sim_get_readiness`, the
        readiness response typically lists 20-50 passives that all
        need the SpicePrefix + Value parameter pair. Attaching them one
        at a time would cost one LLM turn per component (there is no
        singular variant); this tool does the whole set in one round-trip.

        Args:
            attachments: List of attach dicts, each with:
                - designator (str, required)
                - primitive  (str, required), R/L/C/V/I/D/Q/M/X
                - value      (str, optional), "10k", "100n",
                  "DC 5", "SIN(0 1 1k)", etc.
                - spice_model (str, optional), model name for
                  semi/sub-circuit parts
                - sim_kind   (str, optional), "General" /
                  "Subcircuit" / "Model"

        Example, attach the 4 passives from a readiness audit:
            sch_attach_spice_primitives(attachments=[
                {"designator": "R1", "primitive": "R", "value": "10k"},
                {"designator": "R2", "primitive": "R", "value": "10k"},

                {"designator": "C2", "primitive": "C", "value": "1u"},
