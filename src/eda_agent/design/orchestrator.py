"""Top-level orchestrator: plan JSON -> canvas -> Altium emit.

Wraps the three pure-Python stages (symbol extraction, pipeline, emit)
into one entry point the MCP tool layer can call. Returns a result dict
shaped compatibly with the legacy ``ExecutorResult.to_dict()`` so the
``design_execute_plan`` tool can flip between the two paths without
changing its return shape.

What this module is NOT: a placement algorithm. Layout decisions live
in ``pipeline.py``; this is just glue that wires bridge + extractor +
pipeline + emitter together.

    This is what makes the layout engine usable for EDITING rather than

    re-asserts hints after every post-pass, so hinted parts do not move

    - A SINGLE-PIN NET. ``Net.pins`` needs two, so a pin sitting on its
