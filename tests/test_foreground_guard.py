"""Synthesised input must never reach another application.

Every other call in ui/ is addressed to a window handle and physically
cannot go astray. keybd_event and mouse_event are different: they are
delivered to whatever is ACTIVE at the instant they fire, so an event
meant for Altium lands in whatever the user switched to.

The rule these tests hold to is that no such event is emitted without a
foreground check IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT, including between a key press
and its release, because focus moves between one event and the next.
