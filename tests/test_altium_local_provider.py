"""The provider that reads the Altium libraries already on this machine.

It answers a question no other source can: do I ALREADY own this part?
Every other provider proposes something to import, and importing a part
you already have produces a second symbol with a slightly different
name, which is how a library rots.

It is also the only source with no network, no login, no rate limit and
no third party, so it keeps working when every remote one is
unreachable. That matters more than it looks: with the registry
unconfigured and EasyEDA's search endpoint withdrawn upstream, the
remote sources answer very little.

Most assertions here run on a synthetic root rather than the binary
fixture, because ``EDAAgentTest_ICs.SchLib`` is local-only and absent
from a fresh clone. The one test that needs a real OLE library skips
when it is missing, the same way ``test_fileio_schdoc.py`` does.
