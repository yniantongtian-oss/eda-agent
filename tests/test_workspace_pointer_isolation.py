"""The test suite must never repoint a live Altium bridge.

``C:\\ProgramData\\eda-agent\\workspace-path.txt`` is machine-global: it
tells the running DelphiScript loop which directory to poll, and the
script reads it once at startup. A test that writes its tmp workspace
there redirects a live session at a throwaway folder. The failure is
brutal to diagnose from the outside, because the script stays healthy
and simply reports zero requests while every real call times out.

These tests pin the two layers that prevent it: the writer refuses the
machine-global path under pytest, and the pointer location is
overridable so tests can still exercise the writer against scratch.
