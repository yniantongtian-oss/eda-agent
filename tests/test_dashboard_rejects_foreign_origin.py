"""The dashboard drives the EDA application and has no authentication.

``/api/tool/run`` invokes any registered tool with caller-supplied
arguments, which on this project means reading and mutating client
designs under NDA. The only thing between a web page and the board is
that the server listens on loopback.

LOOPBACK IS NOT THE PROTECTION IT LOOKS LIKE. Ordinary CSRF is already
blocked, because the endpoint needs a JSON content type and that forces
a preflight nothing here approves, and the tests below pin that so it
cannot be relaxed by accident. DNS REBINDING is a different attack: a
page served from a domain whose DNS then answers 127.0.0.1 counts as
same-origin to the browser, so no preflight applies and the request
looks entirely ordinary.

MEASURED before the guard existed: a JSON POST carrying
Host: evil.example.com was accepted and ran a command against a live
Altium, and GET /api/tools listed all 412 tools to the same caller.

What separates the cases is the Host header, because a browser sends
the name the user typed. These tests exercise the real app through its
own routes rather than asserting on source.
