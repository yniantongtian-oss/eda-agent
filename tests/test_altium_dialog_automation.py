"""The tool wrapper: what it refuses, and what it authorises.

Only the wrapper is covered here. The decision logic lives in
test_dialog_driver.py, the real-window behaviour in
test_dialog_driver_live_windows.py, and Altium's own control shapes in
test_altium_control_shapes.py.

This file used to also exercise a scripted plan runner. That runner has
been deleted: the tool reacts to whatever dialog is on screen now, and
keeping a second, obsolete mechanism around meant the real-window tests
were pointed at code that no longer shipped.
