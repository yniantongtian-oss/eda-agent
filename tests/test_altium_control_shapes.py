"""The dialog driver must work on ALTIUM's controls, not just Win32's.

Every dialog test before this one drove a PowerShell MessageBox, whose
buttons are the stock Win32 class "Button". Altium's dialogs are VCL and
share none of that, so the whole suite passed while the driver could not
press a single button in Altium.

Both defects were found only by opening a real Engineering Change Order
and reading it:

* ``buttons()`` filtered on "button" in the class name. The ECO's
  buttons are ``TXPBitBtn``, which carries "BitBtn" and NOT "Button", so
  the driver saw ZERO buttons and aborted at its first step every time.
* ``click()`` sent BM_CLICK. A ``TXPBitBtn`` ignores it: the press
  returned cleanly and the dialog stayed open. It answers a posted
  button-down/up pair instead.

The class names and captions below are RECORDED from that dialog
(Altium Designer, 2026-08-17), so this runs in CI with no editor. They
are shapes, not values: no design content is involved.
